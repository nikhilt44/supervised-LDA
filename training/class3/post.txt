OVER a period of nearly three years, Pakistan’s external account had been in surplus. This has come about despite the dismal performance of the export sector, which is the country’s primary source of forex earnings.

Three major factors explain this trend: a dramatic fall in global oil prices (which led to large-scale savings on the oil import bill), rising worker remittances, and higher debt inflows.

Much has already been written about the incurrence of external debt by the current government and the billions of dollars in savings from lower oil payments.

Yet, the importance of worker remittances for the country’s balance of payments position cannot be overstated.

Pakistan relies on remittances for over 36pc of its current account receipts — much higher than the ratio for China (1.6pc) and India (12.2pc)

This heavy dependence on remittances means that Pakistan is that much more exposed to unfolding economic and geopolitical developments in countries that are a major source of these inflows.

The growth in inflows has slowed dramatically from the six-country Gulf Cooperation Council (which has a dominant 64.5pc share in overall remittances), while flows have actually declined from the US (which, until FY2015, was the second-largest source of remittances for Pakistan). 

Remittances from the GCC rose just 5.9pc in 11MFY2016, against nearly 24pc in the same period last year. Meanwhile, remittances from the US dropped 8pc during the period, after rising 8.8pc last year.
